For the project Shell Scripting, below are he steps we used in execution;
1. We statred with the Shell scripting syntax elements where we learnt Variables, control flow, command substitution, input & output and functions.
2. We then wrote our first shell script.
3. Next we went to Directiroy Manupulation and Navigation where we learnt display current directory, create a new directory, change to the new directory,create some files, list files in current directories, and remove new directory & itts contents.
4. The next step was File operation and sorting. Here, we studied files creation, displaying files in their current order, sort the files alphabetically and display the sorted files.
5. The next was working with numbers and calculation where we performed basic arithemetic and some complex calculations
6. Finally, we ended up with File backup and timestamp.

We used gitbash to display our outcome and vi as our command editor.
Every screenshot below has the script written in vi and the outcome displayed ushing gitbash
